[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/thomasbratt/watchmaker/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/thomasbratt/watchmaker/tree/main)

## Features

* Developed as an investigation into capabilities and implementation characteristics
* Written in the Rust programming language
* Supports sparse data that do not fit well into a vector (ie words in a document)
* Has mitigation for very small probabilities (floating point values)

## Usage

* Not recommended for production use. There is no package for this on crates.io
* Install Rust using rustup <https://rustup.rs/>
* Clone the repository (see below)
* Run `cargo test` or `cargo build`

## Example
